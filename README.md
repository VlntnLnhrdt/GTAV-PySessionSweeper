# GTAV-PySessionSweeper
A very small Python-Script to have an empty session. The GTAV process will pause for a few seconds, resulting in a timeout. For you it looks like everybody else left, for everybody else it looks like you left.
The default timeout-length is 10 seconds, you can change it by providing an input with the start of the script.
